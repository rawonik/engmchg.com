                <p> There was nothing in this place a while ago, but the universe is created because the grandfather of Min Chunjae's grandfather x300 coughs.<br><br>
		This cough is what scientists say <em>"BIG BBANG"</em>.(It's delicious)<br><br>
		And somehow, the rice he ate was spilled, and celestial bodies were created, among which the earth was.<br><br>
	  However, Grandpax300+1 was bothersome to clean it up, and suddenly became annoyed and spit, and the DNA in it made our ancestors Min.<br><br> 
		That's how time passed, and Genius Min was born.<br><br>
		It is said that Min Cheon-jae was unique from the time he was born, but from the time he was born he was telling the proof of Fermat's last theorem, who is notorious for fear. <br><br>
		While attending an academy called<em>"jtwo"</em>  After being hit by a person named "***Teacher, ***Teacher, Manhee Jung, Do**, and Kwak**", he became'slightly' dumb, but it is true that he is still smarter than ordinary people.</p>
